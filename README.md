**Framework Reference:** Adapted from *Bev Burgess ‚Äì Account-Based Marketing: Unlocking Growth with ABM*  
**Structure Used:** Identify ‚Üí Expand ‚Üí Engage ‚Üí Convert ‚Üí Grow

## Objective
Rebuild a broken **1:Many demand generation engine** for the India and APAC markets.  
**Goal:** Increase MQL ‚Üí SQL conversion from **4% to 28%** within three quarters.  
**Constraints:** Limited budget, overbroad segmentation, and non-decision-makers flooding the top of the funnel.  

By Q3, campaigns influenced **$25 M in ARR pipeline**, proving how precision segmentation and multichannel orchestration outperform volume marketing.

##  Identify Ideal Customer Profile & Persona Refinement
The first issue was target sprawl. Campaigns reached interns, students, and irrelevant verticals.  
I rebuilt the targeting model from scratch.

**ICP Definition**
- **Industry:** Healthcare, Insurance, and Digital Health SaaS providers with ARR > $20 M  
- **Region:** India, Singapore, and Australia  
- **Buyer Roles:** CMO, Head of Digital Transformation, Marketing Ops, VP‚ÄìGrowth  

**Persona Refinement**
Four data-backed personas derived from CRM + LinkedIn Insights:

| Persona | Focus Area |
|----------|-------------|
| **Decision Maker** (C-level / VP) | ROI, pipeline acceleration |
| **Influencer** (Manager / Lead) | Execution, process efficiency |
| **User** (Specialist / Analyst) | Platform usability, adoption |
| **Procurement Stakeholder** | Compliance, vendor rationalization |

This segmentation became the backbone of channel and content alignment.

##  Expand Segmentation & Data Cleanup
- I Audited 18 months of CRM data to remove duplicates and low-quality leads.  
- Then I Built a **segmentation matrix** combining firmographic + intent + engagement data.  
- Then Added filters for job title, company size, and engagement history to suppress low-value contacts.  
- I Reduced database volume by **42 %**, improving average lead-quality score by **63 %**.  

Fewer leads, higher intent less noise, more signal.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Engage Multichannel Orchestration
With a lean budget, I shifted from volume ads to **experience-based engagement** using three core channels.

| Channel | Objective | Key Tactics |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **LinkedIn Ads** | Reach decision-makers directly with sequenced messaging. | ‚Ä¢ Sponsored InMail from leadership (personalized)<br>‚Ä¢ Carousel ads showing ROI benchmarks per vertical<br>‚Ä¢ Dynamic retargeting using engagement signals |
| **Webinars** | Build trust and demonstrate authority within 1:Few clusters. | ‚Ä¢ *C-suite Dialogue Series* featuring client panels<br>‚Ä¢ Region-specific sessions (India / Singapore / Australia)<br>‚Ä¢ Pre-event polls captured pain points for next-wave content |
| **Email Nurtures** | Convert influencers and users into internal advocates. | ‚Ä¢ Role-based drip journeys<br>‚Ä¢ A/B tested subject lines + CTAs<br>‚Ä¢ Triggered content offers based on engagement score |

Each touchpoint drove to a **personalized resource hub** with segmented content offers and case studies.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Convert Sales Alignment & Funnel Acceleration
- I Integrated **intent scoring** into HubSpot + Salesforce dashboards for SDR visibility.  
- Then Held weekly SDR √ó Marketing syncs to refine outreach messaging per persona.  
- then I replaced generic sequences with **persona-specific follow-ups** (ROI calculator for CMOs, integration guide for Marketing Ops).  

**Results**
- **MQL ‚Üí SQL conversion:** 4 % ‚Üí **28 %**  
- **SQL ‚Üí Opportunity:** 17 % ‚Üí **41 %**  
- **Pipeline influenced:** **$25 M ARR** by end of Q3

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Grow Retention & Advocacy
- I Converted high-engaged webinar attendees into reference clients producing UGC.  
- Then I Launched **‚ÄúChampion Circle‚Äù**: featuring customer execs in campaigns ‚Üí 3√ó engagement uplift.  
- Insights from this program fed Tiered ABM design for future 1:Few / 1:1 rollouts.

## Results Summary

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **MQL ‚Üí SQL Conversion** | 4 % | **28 %** | +24 pts |
| **SQL ‚Üí Opportunity** | 17 % | **41 %** | +24 pts |
| **CPL Reduction** | ‚Äî | **‚Äì33 %** |  |

## üß© Key Learnings
- Narrowing ICP beats expanding reach.  
- Webinars work when framed as *peer-to-peer insights*, not vendor promos.  
- Role-based content sequencing creates micro-momentum within accounts.  
- Real alignment comes from weekly SDR √ó Marketing syncs, not tech stacks.
